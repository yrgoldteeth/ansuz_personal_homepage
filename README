AnsuzPersonalHomepage
=====================
Found a need to direct individual users to a personalized homepage.  This could probably be accomplished via the user roles, but I'm not exactly sure if the feature is exactly finely tuned, so this is a just a one-off little thing until the access control layer is completely fleshed out. 

Install it 
1. After finishing the installation of ansuz_core, enter this address into your browser after the site root:
    /admin/ansuz_plugin_installers/install?name=ansuz_product_manager&repository_url=git://github.com/yrgoldteeth/ansuz_product_manager.git
 
 2. Next, enter this address into your browser after the site root:
    /admin/ansuz_plugin_installers/enable?=ansuz_product_manager

3.  Run rake db:migrate:plugins
